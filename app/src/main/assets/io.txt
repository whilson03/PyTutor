A common scenario in programming is allowing user interact with our programs, i.e getting user inputs
and also displaying outputs for them to see.

In this Chapter we will be focusing on how to get inputs from users and also display some meaningful
information to them after processing their inputs.

Getting user input:

Programs may use the `input()` function to obtain information from the user.

Example:

print("Please enter some text: ")
value = input()
print("Text entered is " + value)


Output:
Please enter some text:
Hello
Text entered is Hello


After the program prints the message `Please enter some text:`, the `input()` causes the programâ€™s execution stops and waits for the user to type some text using the keyboard..
The text is then displayed to the user using the `print()` function.


NB: `input() returns a String.`

input(prompt) also takes an optional prompt which is displayed to the user

Example:

stringNum = input('Enter a number: ')
print(type(stringNum))


Output:

Enter a number:
22
<class 'str'>

Even though the value entered is a number, `input() ` returns a string


But how do we actually get the value inputted as an integer ?

This takes us to Type Conversion

Python has some Built-In functions for converting from one Data type to another.

To convert a string-number ("22") from a string into a number we can use int() or float() functions.

Example:
myString = "24"
myFloat = float(myString)
myInt = int(myString)

print(type(myString))
print(type(myFloat))
print(type(myInt))


<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'int'>

N.B: The `float()` converts the string to a float , while the `int()` converts the string to an integer.
Now these values can be used in arithmetic operations.

Before now we have used the `print()` to display outputs.Lets take a closer look into this function.

The `print()` function is used output data to the standard output device (screen).

print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)


An object or multiple objects Separated by commas `,`.They Will be converted to string before printed.
object in this case refers to Strings,Integer, Floats etc.

Example

print("Hello", "how are you?")

Print more than one object:


sep
This value is optional. It specifies how to separate the objects, if there is more than one.
If no value is provided, the default value is an empty string ' '


end
The purpose of `end=` is to specify what to print at the end of each line.
By default when a print statement is executed, the cursor moves to the next line after printing.This is because by default end='\n'.
`\n` is a special character which means newline,it moves the cursor to the next line.
we can change this behaviour by providing it with what ever we want to get printed after each line

print("jack" , end = '@')
print("pytutor.com")

Whats the output?
print("hello","tom",sep='--',end='&jerry')

hello&jerry--tom&jerry


Whats the default value for `sep= ???`

' ' , \n

\n , ' '

' ', ' '

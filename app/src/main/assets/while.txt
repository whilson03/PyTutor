A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target
statement as long as a given condition is true.

Syntax
The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is:


In a while loop, test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is executed only if the `expression` evaluates to True.

The `while` loop stops execution once the `expression` evaluates to False.

N.B:
In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation.
The body starts with indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.


count = 0
while (count < 4):
    # Body of while loop
    print ('The count is:', count)
    count = count + 1

# end of while loop
print ("Loop Ended!")

The count is: 0
The count is: 1
The count is: 2
The count is: 3
Loop Ended!


You must be cautious when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value


This program evaluates to an Infinite-loop, why?
total = 0
while total <= 3:
    total  = total * 8
    print(total)

total * 8 is always 0 which is less than 3

Its not an infinite loop


The expression is never `True`


How many times will the body of this loop get Executed?
count = 1

while count >= 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 2

<h1>Basic Operators</h1>
Operators are the constructs, which can manipulate the value of operands. Consider the
expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called the operator.
<u>Types of operator</u>

Python language supports the following types of operators-
<ul>
    <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
    <li> Comparison (Relational) Operators</li>
    <li> Assignment Operators</li>
    <li>Logical Operators</li>
    <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
    <li> Membership Operators</li>
    <li>Identity Operators</li>
</ul>
Let us have a look at all the operators one by one.
<p><b><u>Python Arithmetic Operators</u></b></p>
Assume variable a holds the value 10 and variable b holds the value 21, then

    Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then-
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    a = 21<br>
    b = 10<br>
    c = 0<br>
    c = a + b<br>

<u>Python Comparison Operators</u><br>
These operators compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among
them. They are also called Relational operators.
Assume variable a holds the value 10 and variable b holds the value 20, then

<u><b>Python Bitwise Operators</b></u>
Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; Now
in binary format they will be as follows<br>
a= 0011 1100<br>
b = 0000 1101<br>
-----------------<br>
a&b = 0000 1100<br>
a|b = 0011 1101<br>
a^b = 0011 0001<br>
~a = 1100 0011<br>
Pyhton's built-in function bin() can be used to obtain binary representation of an integer
number.</p>

The following Bitwise operators are supported by Python languageOperator

<u><b>Python Logical Operators</b></u>
The following logical operators are supported by Python language. Assume variable a holds True and
variable b holds False then

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th>

        <td> Not(a and b) is True.</td>
    </tr>

<u><b>Python Membership Operators</u></b>
Pythonâ€™s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.
There are two membership operators as explained below
<table>
    <tr>
    <tr>Operator</tr>
    <tr>Description</tr>
    <tr> Example</tr>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>in</td>
        <td>Evaluates to true, if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false
            otherwise.
        </td>
        <td>x in y, here in results in a 1 if x is a member of sequence y.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>not in</td>
        <td> Evaluates to true, if it does not find a variable in the specified sequence and false
            otherwise.
        </td>
        <td>x not in y, here not in results in a 1 if x is not a member of sequence y.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    b = 20<br>
    list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]<br>
    if ( a in list ):<br>

    print ("Line 3 - a is available in the given list")<br>
    else:<br>
    print ("Line 3 - a is not available in the given list")</p>

When you execute the above program, it produces the following resultLine
<p class="one">1 - a is not available in the given list <br>
    Line 2 - b is not available in the given list<br>
    Line 3 - a is available in the given list</p>

<u><b>Python Identity Operators</b></u>
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. There are two Identity
operators as explained below:

        <th>Operator</th>
        <th> Description</th>
        <th> Example</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same
            object and false otherwise.
        </td>
        <td>x is y, here is results in 1 if id(x) equals id(y).</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>is not</td>
        <td> Evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same
            object and true otherwise.
        </td>
        <td>x is not y, here is not results in 1 if id(x) is not equal to id(y).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>

        if ( a is not b ):<br>
        print ("Line 5 - a and b do not have same identity")<br>
        else:<br>
        print ("Line 5 - a and b have same identity")<br>
        When you execute the above program, it produces the following resultLine<br>
        1 a= 20 : 1594701888 b= 20 : 1594701888<br>
        Line 2 - a and b have same identity<br>

Operator precedence affects the evaluation of an an expression. For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x
is assigned 13, not 20 because the operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first multiplies
3*2 and then is added to 7. Here, the operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the
table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom.

Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br><br>
    b = 10<br>
    c = 15<br>
    d = 5<br>
    print ("a:%d b:%d c:%d d:%d" % (a,b,c,d ))<br>
    e = (a + b) * c / d #( 30 * 15 ) / 5<br>
    print ("Value of (a + b) * c / d is ", e)<br>
    e = ((a + b) * c) / d # (30 * 15 ) / 5<br>
    print ("Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is ", e)<br>
    e = (a + b) * (c / d) # (30) * (15/5)<br>
    print ("Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is ", e)<br>
    e = a + (b * c) / d # 20 + (150/5)<br>
    print ("Value of a + (b * c) / d is ", e)</p>

When you execute the above program, it produces the following result
<p class="one">a:20 b:10 c:15 d:5<br>
    Value of (a + b) * c / d is 90.0</p>

<p class="one">Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is 90.0<br>
    Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is 90.0<br>
    Value of a + (b * c) / d is 50.0</p>

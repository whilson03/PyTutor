<h1><b>Exceptions Handling</b></h1>
Python provides two very important features to handle any unexpected error in your Python programs
and to add debugging capabilities in them
<ul>
    <li>Exception Handling.</li>
    <li>Assertions.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Standard Exceptions</u></b><br>
Here is a list of Standard Exceptions available in Python.
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>EXCEPTION NAME</th>
        <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>StandardError</td>
        <td> Base class for all built-in exceptions except StopIteration and SystemExit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ArithmeticError</td>
        <td>Base class for all errors that occur for numeric calculation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> OSError</td>
        <td> Raised for operating system-related errors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SyntaxError</td>
        <td> Raised when there is an error in Python syntax.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>IndexError</td>
        <td> Raised when an index is not found in a sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>KeyError</td>
        <td> Raised when the specified key is not found in the dictionary.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>NameError</td>
        <td> Raised when an identifier is not found in the local or global namespace.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<b><u>Assertions in Python</u></b><br>
An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing
of the program.
<ul>
    <li>The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to be
        more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes
        up false, an exception is raised.
    </li>

    <li>Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced
        in version 1.5.
    </li>

    <li>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and
        after a function call to check for valid output.
    </li>
</ul>
<b><u>The assert Statement</u></b><br>
When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is
hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises anAssertionError exception.
The syntax for assert is
<p class="one">assert Expression[, Arguments] </p>
If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError.
AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception, using the try-except
statement. If they are not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.
<b>Example</b>
Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit.
Since 0Â° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative temperature
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ((Temperature-273)*1.8)+32 <br>

    print (KelvinToFahrenheit(273)) <br>
    print (int(KelvinToFahrenheit(505.78))) <br>
    print (KelvinToFahrenheit(-5)) </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">32.0 <br>
    451 <br>
    Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
    File "test.py", line 9, in <br>
    print KelvinToFahrenheit(-5) <br>
    File "test.py", line 4, in KelvinToFahrenheit <br>
    assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!" <br>
    AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero! </p>
<b><u>What is Exception?</u></b><br>
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal
flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it
cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.
When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise
it terminates and quits.</p>
<b><u>Handling an Exception</u></b><br>
If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing
the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by
a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible. </p>
<b><u>Syntax </u></b><br>
Here is simple syntax of try....except...else blocks
<p class="one">try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do your operations here <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................... <br>


    except ExceptionI: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block. <br>
    except ExceptionII: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................... <br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no exception then execute this block. </p>
Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax
<ul>
    <li>A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try
        block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.
    </li>

    <li>You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.</li>

    <li> After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the elseblock
        executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.
    </li>

    <li>The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example</b><br> This example opens a file, writes content in the file and comes out gracefully
because there is no problem at all.
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>

    try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fh = open("testfile", "w") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")<br>
    except IOError: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data") <br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Written content in the file successfully") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fh.close() </p>
This produces the following result
<p class="one">Written content in the file successfully </p>
<b><u>Argument of an Exception</u></b><br>
An exception can have an argument, which is a value that gives additional information about the
problem. The contents of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by
supplying a variable in the except clause as follows
<p class="one">&nbsp;try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do your operations here<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......................<br>
    &nbsp;except ExceptionType as Argument: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can print value of Argument here... </p>
If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the
exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable
follow the tuple of the exception.
This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The
variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually
contains the error string, the error number, and an error location. </p>
<b>Example</b><br>
Following is an example for a single exception
<p class="one">&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;# Define a function here. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;def temp_convert(var): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;returnint(var) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;except ValueError as Argument:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;print("The argument does not contain numbers\n",Argument) <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;# Call above function here. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;temp_convert("xyz") </p>
This produces the following result
<p class="one">The argument does not contain numbers<br>
    invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz' </p>
<b><u>Raising an Exception</u></b><br>
You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the
raise statement is as follows</p>
<b>Syntax</b><br>
<p class="one">raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]</p>
Here, Exception is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and argument is a value for the
exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.
The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is
the traceback object used for the exception.
<b>Example</b><br>
An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core
raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is
quite easy and can be done as follows
<p class="one">def functionName( level ): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if level <1: ><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raise Exception(level <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # The code below to this would not be executed <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # if we raise the exception <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return level </p>
<b>Note</b>: In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception
thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above exception, we
must write the except clause as follows</p>
<p class="one">try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Logic here... <br>
    except Exception as e: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exception handling here using e.args...<br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest of the code here... </p>
<b><u>User-Defined Exceptions</u></b><br>
Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in
exceptions.
Here is an example related to RuntimeError. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from
RuntimeError. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is
caught.
In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable
e is used to create an instance of the class Networkerror. </p>
<p class="one">class Networkerror(RuntimeError):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self, arg):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.args = arg </p>
So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows
<p class="one">try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; raise Networkerror("Bad hostname") <br>
    except Networkerror,e: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print e.args </p>

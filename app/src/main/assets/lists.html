<h1><b>Lists</b></h1>
The most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. Each element of a sequence is assigned a
number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.
Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are lists and tuples, which we
would see in this tutorial.
There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. These operations include indexing,
slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in
functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest
elements.</p>
<b><u>Python Lists</u></b><br>
The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, which can be written as a list of
comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that the
items in a list need not be of the same type.
Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets.
For example</p>
<p class="one">list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];<br>
    list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; <br>
    list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]; </p>
Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be sliced, concatenated and so
on. </p>
<b><u>Accessing Values in Lists</u></b><br>
To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to
obtain value available at that index. For example</p>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000] <br>
    list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ] <br>
    print ("list1[0]: ", list1[0])<br>
    print ("list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5])</p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">list1[0]: physics <br>
    list2[1:5]: [2, 3, 4, 5] </p>
<b><u>Updating Lists</u></b><br>
You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the
assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append() method. For example-
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000] <br>
    print ("Value available at index 2 : ", list[2]) <br>
    list[2] = 2001<br>
    print ("New value available at index 2 : ", list[2])</p>
<b>Note</b>: The append() method is discussed in the subsequent section. <br>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">Value available at index 2 :<br>
    1997 <br>
    New value available at index 2 :<br>
    2001 </p>
<u><b>Delete List</b></u><br>
Elements To remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which
element(s) you are deleting. You can use the remove() method if you do not know exactly which items
to delete. For example-
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]<br>
    print (list) <br>
    del list[2] <br>
    print ("After deleting value at index 2 : ", list)</p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000] <br>
    After deleting value at index 2 : ['physics', 'chemistry', 2000]</p>
<b> Note</b>: remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>
<b><u>Basic List Operations</u></b><br>
Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition
here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.
In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior
chapter</p>

<b><u>Built-in List Functions</u></b><br>
Methods Python includes the following list functions
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>SN</th>
        <th> Function with Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td> cmp(list1, list2)
            No longer available in Python 3.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td> len(list)
            Gives the total length of the list.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>max(list)
            Returns item from the list with max value.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td> min(list)
            Returns item from the list with min value.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>list(seq)
            Converts a tuple into list.
        </td>

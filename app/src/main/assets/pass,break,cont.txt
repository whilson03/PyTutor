In Python, pass is a null statement. The interpreter does not ignore a pass statement, but nothing happens and the statement results into no operation.

Example:
mList = [1, 2, 4, 6]
for number in mList:
    pass
`pass` is just a placeholder for functionality to be added later.


The break statement is used for premature termination of the current loop.
After terminating the loop, execution at the next statement is resumed.

The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.

If the break statement is inside a nested loop (i.e loop inside another loop), the break statement will terminate the innermost loop.

for letter in 'Python':
    if letter == 'h':
        continue
    print ('Current Letter :', letter)


That is, the current iteration of the loop will be disrupted, but the program will return to the top of the loop.

<h1><u><b>Classes</b></u></h1>
Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and
using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using
Python's object-oriented programming support.
If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to
consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of
the basic concepts.
However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you. </p>
<b><u>Overview of OOP Terminology</u></b>
<ul>
    <li><b> Class</b> : A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that
        characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and
        instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
    </li>
    <li><b>Class variable</b>: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class
        variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables
        are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
    </li>

    <li><b>Data member</b> : A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a
        class and its objects.
    </li>

    <li><b>Function overloading</b> : The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular
        function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.
    </li>

    <li><b> Instance variable</b> : A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to
        the current instance of a class.
    </li>

    <li><b>Inheritance</b> : The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that
        are derived from it.
    </li>

    <li><b>Instanc</b> e: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a
        class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
    </li>

    <li><b> Instantiation</b>: The creation of an instance of a class.</li>

    <li><b>Method</b> : A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>

    <li><b>Object</b> : A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An
        object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.
    </li>

    <li><b> Operator overloading</b> : The assignment of more than one function to a particular
        operator.
    </li>
</ul>
<u><b>Creating Classes</b></u><br>
The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the
keyword class followed by a colon as follows
<p class="one">class ClassName: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Optional class documentation string' <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class_suite </p>
<ul>
    <li>The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed <b>viaClassName.__doc__. </b>
    </li>

    <li>The <b>class_suite</b> consists of all the component statements defining class members, data
        attributes and functions.
    </li>
</ul>
Example Following is an example of a simple Python class
<p class="one">&nbsp;class Employee: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Common base class for all employees'<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;empCount = 0 <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, name, salary): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.name = name <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.salary = salary <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employee.empCount += 1 <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def displayCount(self):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def displayEmployee(self):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Name : ", self.name, ", Salary: ", self.salary) </p>
<ul>
    <li>The variable empCount is a class variable whose value is shared among all the instances of
        <b>a</b> in this class. This can be accessed as Employee.empCount from inside the class or
        outside the class.
    </li>

    <li>The first method <b> __init__()</b> is a special method, which is called class constructor
        or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.
    </li>

    <li>You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first
        argument to each method is self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do
        not need to include it when you call the methods.
    </li>
</ul>
<b><u>Creating Instance Objects</u></b><br>
To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments
its __init__ method accepts.
This would create first object of Employee class
<p class="one">emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000) <br>

    This would create second object of Employee class <br>
    emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000) </p>
<b><u>Built-In Class</u></b><br>
Attributes Every Python class keeps the following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using
dot operator like any other attribute âˆ’
<ul>
    <li><b> __dict__</b>: Dictionary containing the class's namespace.</li>
    <li><b> __doc__</b>: Class documentation string or none, if undefined.</li>
    __name__: Class name.
    <li><b>__module__</b> : Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__"
        in interactive mode.
    </li>
    <li>__bases__: A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their
        occurrence in the base class list.
    </li>
    For the above class let us try to access all these attributes
</ul>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>

    &nbsp; class Employee:<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Common base class for all employees' <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; empCount = 0 <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, name, salary): <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.name = name <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.salary = salary <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Employee.empCount += 1 <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; def displayCount(self): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount) <br>

    &nbsp; def displayEmployee(self): <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; print ("Name : ", self.name, ", Salary: ", self.salary) <br>

    emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)<br>
    emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000) <br>
    print ("Employee.__doc__:", Employee.__doc__) <br>
    print ("Employee.__name__:", Employee.__name__) <br>
    print ("Employee.__module__:", Employee.__module__) <br>
    print ("Employee.__bases__:", Employee.__bases__) <br>
    print ("Employee.__dict__:", Employee.__dict__ ) </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">Employee.__doc__: Common base class for all employees <br>
    Employee.__name__: Employee <br>
    Employee.__module__: __main__ <br>
    Employee.__bases__: (,) <br>
    Employee.__dict__: {'displayCount': , '__module__': '__main__', '__doc__': 'Common base class
    for all employees', 'empCount': 2, '__init__': , 'displayEmployee': , '__weakref__': ,
    '__dict__': } </p>

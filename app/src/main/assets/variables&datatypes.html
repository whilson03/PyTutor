<h1><b><u>Variables and Types</u></b></h1>
<p>it's a lot easier in Python. There is no declaration of variable required in python. It's not
    even possible. If there is need of a variable, you think of a name and start using it as a
    variable.
<p>

<p>Another remarkable aspect of python: Not only the value of a variable may change during program
    execution but the type as well. You can assign an integer value to a variable, use it as an
    integer for a while and then assign a string to the same variable. In the following line of
    code, we assign the value 42 to a variable:
<p>
    i = 42

<p>The equal "=" sign in the assignment shouldn't be seen as "is equal to". It should be "read" or
    interpreted as "is set to", meaning in our example "the variable i is set to 42". Now we will
    increase the value of the variable by 1:
<p>

<p style="background-color:grey;">>> i = i + 1<br>
    >> print(i)<br>
    43
    >>></p>
<p> As we have said above, the type of a variable can change during the execution of a script. or to
    be precised: A new object, which can be of any type, will be assigned to it. we illustrate this
    in our following example:
    example:
<p style="background-color:grey;"> i = 42 # data type is implicitly set to integer<br>
    i = 42 + 0.11 # data type is changed to float<br>
    i = "forty" # and now it will be a string <br>
</p>
Python automatically takes care of the physical representation for different data types, i.e. an
integer values will be stored in a different memeory location than a float or string.

<h2><b><u>Object References</u></b></h2>
<p>We want to take a closer look on variables now. Python variables are references to objects,but
    the actual data is contained in the objects. As variables are pointing to objects and objects
    can be of arbitary data type, variablescannot have types associated with them. This is a huge
    difference to C, C++ or Java, where a variable is associated with a fixed data type. This
    association can't be changed as long as the program is running. Therefore it is possible to
    write code like thwe following in python:
<p>
<p style="background-color:grey;">>>> x = 42<br>
    >>> print(x)<br>
    42<br>
    >>> x = "Now x references a string"<br>
    >>> x references a string</p>
We want to demonstrate something else now. Let's look at the following code:
<p style="background-color:grey;">>>> x = 42<br>
    >>> y = x</p>
We created and integer object 42 and assigned it to the variable x. After this we assigned x to the
variable y. This means that both variable reference the same object. The following picture
ilustrates this: What will happen, when we execute
<p style="background-color:grey">y = 78</p>
after the previous code? Python will create a new integer object with the content 78 and then the
variable y will reference this new created object, as we can see in the following picture: Most
probabaly, we will see further changes to the variables in the flow of our program. There might be
for example a string assignment to the variable x. The previously integer object "42" will be
orphaned after this assignment. It will be removed by Python, because no other variable is
referencing.</p>
<b>id function</b>
You may ask yourself, how can we see or prove that x and y really reference the same object after
the assignment y = x of our previous example?
<p>The identity function id() can be used for this purpose. Every instance(object or variable) has
    an identity i.e. an integer which is unique within the script or program, i.e. other object have
    different identities.
    so, let's have a look at our previous example and how the the identities will change:
<p style="background-color:grey;">>>> x = 42 <br>
    >>> id(x)<br>
    10107136<br>
    >>> y = x<br>
    >>> id(x), id(y)<br>
    (10107136, 10107136)<br>
    >>>id(x), id(y)<br>
    (10107136, 10108288)<br>
    >>>
<h3><b><u>Valid Variable Names</u></b></h3>
<p>The naming of variables follow the more general concept of an identifier. A python identifier is
    a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module of other object.
    A variable name and an identifier can consist of the uppercase letters "A" through "Z", the
    lowercase letters "a" through "z", the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the
    digits 0 through 9. Python 3.x is based on Unicode. This means that variable names and
    identifier names can additionally contain Unicode character as well. But in Python 2,
    identifiers can only be ASCII letters, numbers and underscores.
    Identifiers are unlimited in length. Case is significant. The fact that identifier names are
    case-sensitive can cause problems to some windows users, where file names are case-insensitive
    for example.</p>

<ol
= type="1">
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Tuple</li>
<li>Dictionary</li>
</ol>
<h5><b><u>Numbers</u></b></h5>
<p>Python supports four types of numbers - int,long,float and complex<br> For example<br>
    3(int),4.0(float),51924361L(long),3.14j(complex)</p>
<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x + yj,
    where x and y are the real numbers and j is the imaginary unit</p>
<p>To define an integer, use the following syntax:
<p style="background-color:grey;">myint = 7</p>
To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:
<p style="background-color:grey;">my float = 7.0<br>
    myfloat = float(7)<br>
<h6><b><u>Strings</u></b></h6>
<p>Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes</p>
<p style="background-color:grey;">mystring = 'hello'<br>
    mystring = "hello"</p>
There are additional variations on defining strings that makes it easier to include things such as
carriage returns, backslashes and unicode characters. There are beyond the scope of this tutorial,
but are covered in the Python documentation.
simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:
<p style="background-color:grey;">one = 1<br>
    two = 2<br>
    three = one + two<br>
    hello = "hello"<br>
    world = "world"<br>
    helloworld = hello + " " + world</p>
Assignmenets can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this
<p style="background-color:grey;">a, b = 3, 4</p>

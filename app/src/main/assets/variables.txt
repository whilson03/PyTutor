Variables are reserved memory locations to store values.

When a variable is created, you reserve some space in the memory.

The Datatype of the variable determines how much memory  is allocated.

Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

The ' = ' Assignment operator is used to assign values to variables.

//CODE

myWeight = 34.6     # a floating point

myName   = "wilson" # a string

myAge    = 14       # an integer

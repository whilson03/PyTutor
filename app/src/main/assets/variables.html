<h1><b>VARIABLE AND TYPES</b></h1>
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a
variable, you reserve some space in the memory.
Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be
stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you
can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
<u><b>Assigning Values to Variables</b></u><br>
Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens
automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to
variables.
The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right
of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. </p>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    counter = 100 # An integer assignment <br>
    miles = 1000.0 # A floating point <br>
    name = "Emmanuel" # A string <br>
    print (counter) <br>
    print (miles) <br>
    print (name) </p>
The output gives the following result</p>
<p class="one">100 <br>
    1000.0 <br>
    Emmanuel</p>
<b><u>Multiple Assignment</u></b><br>
Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.
For example
<p class="one">a = b = c = 20</p>
Here, an integer object is created with the value 20, and all the three variables are assigned to
the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables.
For example
<p class="one">a, b, c = 1, 2, "Emmanuel" </p>
Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b respectively,
and one string object with the value "Emmanuel" is assigned to the variable c.</p>
<b><u>Standard Data Types</u></b><br> The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a
person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric
characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible
on them and the storage method for each of them.
Python has five standard data types
<ul>
    <li>Numbers</li>
    <li> String</li>
    <li> List</li>
    <li> Tuple</li>
    <li>Dictionary</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Python Numbers Number</u></b><br>
data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For
example
<p class="one">var1 = 1 <br>
    var2 = 10 </p>
You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax
of the <b>del</b> statement is
<p class="one">del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]] </p>
You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement.
For example
<p class="one">del var <br>
    del var_a, var_b </p>
Python supports three different numerical types
<ul>
    <li> int (signed integers)</li>
    <li> float (floating point real values)</li>
    <li>complex (complex numbers)</li>
</ul>
All integers in Python 3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type
as long.
Examples Here are some examples of numbers

A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x + yj, where
x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.

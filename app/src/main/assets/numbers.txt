Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a
value to them.

Example

number1 = 90
number2 = 23.8
number3 = 2 + 5j

Python supports three different numerical types:
 int (signed integers)
 float (floating point real values)
 complex (complex numbers)

You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement.

del var
del var_a, var_b

Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operations are a common task in our everyday life, its also a common task in programming.

Lets create  two variables to illustrate these operators

number1 = 5
number2 = 2

we would be using these variables to illustrate all the Arithmetic Operators in Python.

+ Addition : Adds values on either side of the operator.

print(number1 + number2)


 - Subtraction Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.

 print(number1 - number2)

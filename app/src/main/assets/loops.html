<h1><b>loops</b></h1>
<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially- The first statement in a function is executed
    first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a
    block of code several number of times.
    Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution
    paths.
    A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The
    following diagram illustrates a loop statement.</p>
Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Loop type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>while loop</td>
        <td>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the
            condition before executing the loop body.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td> for loop</td>
        <td> Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages
            the loop variable.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td> nested loops</td>
        <td> You can use one or more loop inside any another while, or for loop.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<b><u>while Loop Statements</u></b><br>
A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long
as a given condition is true.</p>
<b>Syntax</b><br>
The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is
<p class="one">while expression: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;statement(s) </p>
Here, <b>statement(s)</b> may be a single statement or a block of statements with uniform indent.
The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the
condition is true.
When the <b>condition</b> becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following
the loop.
In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming
construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method
of grouping statements. </p>

When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first
statement after the while loop will be executed.</p>
<b>Example</b>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>

    count = 0 <br>
    while (count < 9):<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('The count is:', count)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;count = count + 1 <br>

    print ("Good bye!") </p>

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result<br>
<p class="one">The count is: 0 <br>
    The count is: 1 <br>
    The count is: 2 <br>
    The count is: 3 <br>
    The count is: 4 </p>

<p class="one">The count is: 5<br>
    The count is: 6 <br>
    The count is: 7 <br>
    The count is: 8 <br>
    Good bye! </p>
The block here, consisting of the print and increment statements, is executed repeatedly until count
is no longer less than 9. With each iteration, the current value of the index count is displayed and
then increased by 1. </p>
<b>The Infinite Loop</b><br>
A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must be cautious when using
while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value. This
results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.
An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run
continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required. </p>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    var = 1 <br>
    while var == 1 : &nbsp;# This constructs an infinite loop<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;num = int(input("Enter a number :")) <br>
    print ("You entered: ", num) <br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<p class="one">Enter a number :20 <br>
    You entered: 20 <br>
    Enter a number :29 <br>
    You entered: 29 <br>
    Enter a number :3 <br>
    You entered: 3 <br>
    Enter a number :11 <br>
    You entered: 11 <br>
    Enter a number :22 <br>
    You entered: 22 <br>
    Enter a number :Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
    File "examples\test.py", line 5, in <br>
    num = int(input("Enter a number :")) <br>
    KeyboardInterrupt </p>

The above example goes in an infinite loop and you need to use CTRL+C to exit the program.</p>
<b>Using else Statement with Loops</b><br>
Python supports having an else statement associated with a loop statement.
<ul>
    <li> If the else statement is used with a for loop, the else statement is executed when the loop
        has exhausted iterating the list.
    </li>
    <li> If the else statement is used with a while loop, the else statement is executed when the
        condition becomes false.
    </li>
</ul>
The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a while statement that
prints a number as long as it is less than 5, otherwise the else statement gets executed.

<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    count = 0 <br>
    while count < 5:<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;print (count, " is less than 5")<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;count = count + 1 <br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;print (count, " is not less than 5")</p>

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-
<p class="one"> is less than 5 <br>
    1 is less than 5 <br>
    2 is less than 5 <br>
    3 is less than 5 <br>
    4 is less than 5 <br>
    5 is not less than 5 </p>

<b>Single Statement</b><br>
Suites Similar to the if statement syntax, if your <b>while</b> clause consists only of a single
statement, it may be placed on the same line as the while header. Here is the syntax and example of
a <b>one-line while</b> clause

<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    flag = 1 <br>
    while (flag):<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; print ('Given flag is really true!')<br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>

The above example goes into an infinite loop and you need to press CTRL+C keys to exit. </p>
<b><u>for Loop Statements</u></b><br>
The for statement in Python has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a
list or a string. </p>

<b>Syntax </b>
<p class="one">for iterating_var in sequence:<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;statements(s)</p>

If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the
sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Next, the statements block is
executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the statement(s) block is executed
until the entire sequence is exhausted.</p>

<b>The range() function </b><br>
The built-in function range() is the right function to iterate over a sequence of numbers. It
generates an iterator of arithmetic progressions. </p>
<p class="one"> >>> range(5) <br>
    range(0, 5) <br>
    >>> list(range(5))<br>
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] </p>

range() generates an iterator to progress integers starting with 0 upto n-1. To obtain a list object
of the sequence, it is typecasted to list(). Now this list can be iterated using the for statement.
<p class="one">for var in list(range(5)): <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print (var)</p>
This will produce the following output.
<p class="one">0 <br>
    1 <br>
    2 <br>
    3 <br>
    4 </p>

<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    for letter in 'Python': &nbsp; # traversal of a string sequence <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('Current Letter :', letter) <br>
    print() <br>
    fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'mango'] <br>
    for fruit in fruits: # traversal of List sequence<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('Current fruit :', fruit)<br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result âˆ’
<p class="one">Current Letter : P<br>
    Current Letter : y </p>

<p class="one">Current Letter : t <br>
    Current Letter : h <br>
    Current Letter : o <br>
    Current Letter : n <br>

    Current fruit : banana <br>
    Current fruit : apple <br>
    Current fruit : mango<br>
    Good bye</p>

Iterating by Sequence Index An alternative way of iterating through each item is by index offset
into the sequence itself. Following is a simple example-
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'mango']<br>
    for index in range(len(fruits)): <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('Current fruit :', fruits[index])<br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>


When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-
<p class="one">Current fruit : banana<br>
    Current fruit : mango <br>
    Good bye! </p>
Here, we took the assistance of the len() built-in function, which provides the total number of
elements in the tuple as well as the range() built-in function to give us the actual sequence to
iterate over</p>

<b>Using else Statement with Loops</b>
Python supports having an else statement associated with a loop statement.
<ul>
    <li>If the else statement is used with a for loop, the else block is executed only if for loops
        terminates normally (and not by encountering break statement).
    </li>
    <li>If the else statement is used with a while loop, the else statement is executed when the
        condition becomes false.
    </li>
</ul>


The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a for statement that
searches for even number in given list</p>

<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    numbers=[11,33,55,39,55,75,37,21,23,41,13]<br>
    for num in numbers: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;if num%2==0:<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('the list contains an even number')<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;break <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print ('the list doesnot contain even number') </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-
<p class="one">the list does not contain even number</p>
<b><u>Nested loops</u></b><br>
Python programming language allows the use of one loop inside another loop. The following section
shows a few examples to illustrate the concept. </p>
<b>Syntax</b>
<p class="one">for iterating_var in sequence: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for iterating_var in sequence: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;statements(s) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;statements(s) </p>
The syntax for a nested while loop statement in Python programming language is as follows-
<p class="one">while expression:<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;statement(s) </p>
A final note on loop nesting is that you can put any type of loop inside any other type of loop. For
example a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.</p>
<b>Example</b><br>
The following program uses a nested-for loop to display multiplication tables from 1-10.
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    import sys </p>

<p class="one">for i in range(1,11):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for j in range(1,11): <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;k=i*j <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print (k, end=' ') <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print() </p>
The print() function inner loop has end=' ' which appends a space instead of default newline. Hence,
the numbers will appear in one row. Last print() will be executed at the <b>end</b> of inner for
loop.
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result âˆ’
<p class="one">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br>
    2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 <br>
    3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 <br>
    4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40<br>
    5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 <br>
    6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60<br>
    7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70<br>
    8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 <br>
    9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 <br>
    10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 </p>

<b> Loop Control Statements </b><br>
The Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When the execution leaves
a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
Python supports the following control statements.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Control Statement</th>
        <th> Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>break statement</td>
        <td> Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately
            following the loop.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>continue statement</td>
        <td> Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition
            prior to reiterating.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>pass statement</td>
        <td> The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you
            do not want any command or code to execute.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


Let us go through the loop control statements briefly. </p>
<b><u>break statement</u></b><br>
The break statement is used for premature termination of the current loop. After abandoning the
loop, execution at the next statement is resumed, just like the traditional break statement in C.
The most common use of break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit
from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.
If you are using nested loops, the break statement stops the execution of the innermost loop and
starts executing the next line of the code after the block.</p>
<b>Syntax </b><br>
The syntax for a break statement in Python is as follows-
<p class="one">break </p>

Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    for letter in 'Python': # First Example <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if letter == 'h': <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('Current Letter :', letter) <br>
    var = 10 # Second Example <br>
    while var > 0: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('Current variable value :', var) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var = var -1 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if var == 5: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break <br>

    print ("Good bye!") </p>


When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-
<p class="one">Current Letter : P <br>
    Current Letter : y <br>
    Current Letter : t </p>

<p class="one">Current variable value : 10 <br>
    Current variable value : 9 <br>
    Current variable value : 8 <br>
    Current variable value : 7 <br>
    Current variable value : 6 <br>
    Good bye! </p>
The following program demonstrates the use of break in a for loop iterating over a list. User inputs
a number, which is searched in the list. If it is found, then the loop terminates with the 'found'
message.
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    no=int(input('any number: ')) <br>
    numbers=[11,33,55,39,55,75,37,21,23,41,13] <br>
    for num in numbers: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if num==no: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('number found in list') <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('number not found in list') </p>
The above program will produce the following output-
<p class="one">any number: 33 <br>
    number found in list <br>
    any number: 5 <br>
    number not found in list </p>
<b><u>continue Statement</u></b><br>
The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the current loop. When
encountered, the loop starts next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the
current iteration.
The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops. </p>
<b>Syntax </b>
<p class="one">continue</p>

Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>

    for letter in 'Python': # First Example <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if letter == 'h':<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('Current Letter :', letter) <br>
    var = 10 # Second Example <br>
    while var > 0: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var = var -1 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if var == 5:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('Current variable value :', var) <br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>


When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-
<p class="one">Current Letter : P </p>

<p class="one">Current Letter : y<br>
    Current Letter : t <br>
    Current Letter : o <br>
    Current Letter : n <br>
    Current variable value : 9 <br>
    Current variable value : 8 <br>
    Current variable value : 6 <br>
    Current variable value : 4 <br>
    Current variable value : 3 <br>
    Current variable value : 2 <br>
    Current variable value : 1 <br>
    Current variable value : 0 <br>
    Good bye! </p>
<b><u>pass Statement</u></b>
It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to
execute.
The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. The pass statement is also
useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not been written yet i.e. in
stubs). </p>
<b>Syntax</b>
<p class="one">pass </p>
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>

    for letter in 'Python': <br>
    if letter == 'h': <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print ('This is pass block') <br>
    print ('Current Letter :', letter) <br>

    print ("Good bye!") </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result-

<p class="one">Current Letter : P <br>
    Current Letter : y <br>
    This is pass block <br>
    Current Letter : n <br>
    Good bye! </p>

<u><b>Iterator and Generator</b></u><br>
<b> Iterator </b>is an object, which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a
collection, regardless of its specific implementation. In Python, an iterator object implements two
methods, <b>iter()</b> and <b>next(). </b>
String, List or Tuple objects can be used to create an Iterator.
<p class="one">list=[1,2,3,4] <br>
    it = iter(list) # this builds an iterator object <br>
    print (next(it)) #prints next available element in iterator <br>
    # Iterator object can be traversed using regular for statement <br>
    !usr/bin/python3 <br>
    for x in it: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print (x, end=" ") <br>
    # or using next() function <br>
    while True: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print (next(it)) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except StopIteration: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sys.exit() #you have to import sys module for this </p>
A <b>generator</b> is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.
When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution
of the function. When the next() method is called for the first time, the function starts executing,
until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. The yield keeps track i.e.
remembers the last execution and the second next() call continues from previous value.
The following example defines a generator, which generates an iterator for all the Fibonacci
numbers.
<p class="one">!usr/bin/python3<br>
    import sys <br>
    def fibonacci(n): #generator function<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a, b, counter = 0, 1, 0 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while True: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (counter > n): <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yield a <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a, b = b, a + b <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counter += 1 <br>
    f = fibonacci(5) #f is iterator object <br>
    while True: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print (next(f), end=" ") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except StopIteration: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sys.exit() </p>

<h1><b>Decision Making</b></h1>
Decision-making is the anticipation of conditions occurring during the execution of a program and
specified actions taken according to the conditions.
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions, which produce TRUE or FALSE as the outcome. You
need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if the outcome is TRUE or
FALSE otherwise.
Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the
programming languages-
Python programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and <b>non-null</b> values as TRUE, and any
<b>zero</b> or <b>null values</b> as FALSE value.</p>
Python programming language provides the following types of decision-making statements</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Statement</th>
        <th>Decription</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>if statements</td>
        <td>An if statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>if...else statements</td>
        <td>An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the
            boolean expression is FALSE.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>nested if statements</td>
        <td>You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Let us go through each decision-making statement quickly. </p>
<b><u>IF Statement</u></b><br>
The IF statement is similar to that of other languages. The if statement contains a logical
expression using which the data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the
comparison.
<b>Syntax</b>
<p class="one">if expression: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) </p>
If the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE, then the block of statement(s) inside the if statement
is executed. In Python, statements in a block are uniformly indented after the : symbol. If boolean
expression evaluates to FALSE, then the first set of code after the end of block is executed</p>
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    var1 = 100<br>
    if var1: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("1 - Got a true expression value") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print (var1) </p>


<p class="one">var2 = 0<br>
    if var2: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("2 - Got a true expression value")<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print (var2) <br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">1 - Got a true expression value <br>
    100 <br>
    Good bye! </p>

<b><u>IF...ELIF...ELSE Statements </u></b><br>
An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains a block of code
that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at the most only one else statement
following if.
<b>Syntax</b>
The syntax of the if...else statement is
<p class="one">if expression: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s)<br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s)</p>
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    amount=int(input("Enter amount: "))<br>
    if amount<1000: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; discount=amount*0.05 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Discount",discount) <br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; discount=amount*0.10 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Discount",discount)<br>

    print ("Net payable:",amount-discount)</p>
In the above example, discount is calculated on the input amount. Rate of discount is 5%, if the
amount is less than 1000, and 10% if it is above 10000. When the above code is executed, it produces
the following result-
<p class="one">Enter amount: 600 <br>
    Discount 30.0 <br>
    Net payable: 570.0 <br>
    Enter amount: 1200 <br>
    Discount 120.0 <br>
    Net payable: 1080.0 </p>

<b><u>The elif Statement</u></b><br>
The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as
soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. However, unlike else, for which there can be at
the most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.
<b>Syntax </b>
<p class="one">if expression1:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    elif expression2: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    elif expression3: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) </p>
Core Python does not provide switch or case statements as in other languages, but we can use
if..elif...statements to simulate switch case as follows
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    amount=int(input("Enter amount: ")) <br>

    if amount<1000:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; discount=amount*0.05 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Discount",discount) <br>
    elif amount<5000: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; discount=amount*0.10 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Discount",discount)<br>
    else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; discount=amount*0.15 <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Discount",discount) print ("Net payable:",amount-discount) </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result

<p class="one">Enter amount: 600 <br>
    Discount 30.0 <br>
    Net payable: 570.0<br>

    Enter amount: 3000 <br>
    Discount 300.0 <br>
    Net payable: 2700.0 <br>

    Enter amount: 6000 <br>
    Discount 900.0 <br>
    Net payable: 5100.0 </p>
<b><u>Nested IF Statements</u></b><br>
There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to
true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.
In a nested if construct, you can have an if...elif...else construct inside another if...elif...else
construct. </p>
<b>Syntax</b>
The syntax of the nested if...elif...else construct may be-
<p class="one">&nbsp;&nbsp;if expression1: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if expression2: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elif expression3: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;elif expression4: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement(s) </p>
Example
<p class="one"># !/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    num=int(input("enter number")) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;if num%2==0: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if num%3==0: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("Divisible by 3 and 2") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("divisible by 2 not divisible by
    3") <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if num%3==0:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print ("divisible by 3 not divisible by 2")<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print ("not Divisible by 2 not divisible
    by 3") </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">enter number8 <br>
    divisible by 2 not divisible by 3<br>
    enter number15 <br>
    divisible by 3 not divisible by 2 <br>

    enter number12 <br>
    Divisible by 3 and 2 <br>

    enter number5 <br>
    not Divisible by 2 not divisible by 3 </p>
<b><u>Single Statement Suites</u></b><br>
If the suite of an if clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as the
header statement.</p>
Here is an example of a one-line if clause-
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    var = 100 <br>
    if ( var == 100 ) : print ("Value of expression is 100") <br>
    print ("Good bye!") </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">Value of expression is 100 <br>
    Good bye!</p>

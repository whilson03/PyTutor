<h1>Tuples</h1>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The
    main difference between the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike
    lists i.e they are immutable. Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

    Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally, you can
    put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example −
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d"
</pre>
</div>
The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing −
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1 = ();
</pre>
</div>
To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only
one value −
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1 = (50,)
</pre>
</div>
Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.

<h3>Accessing Values in Tuples</h3>
To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to
obtain the value available at that index. For example −
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )

print ("tup1[0]: ", tup1[0])
print ("tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5])
</pre>
</div>
The output of the code above is given as:
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1[0]:  physics
tup2[1:5]:  (2, 3, 4, 5)
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Updating Tuples</h3>
Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are
able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example
demonstrates −
<div class="code">
<pre>
tup1 = (12, 34.56)
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz')

# Following action is not valid for tuples
# tup1[0] = 100;

# So let's create a new tuple as follows
tup3 = tup1 + tup2
print (tup3)
</pre>
</div>

The output of the code above is given as:
<div class="code">
<pre>
(12, 34.56, 'abc', 'xyz')
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Delete Tuple Elements</h3>
Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting
together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.

To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the del statement. For example −
<div class="code">
<pre>
my_tup = ("school","reading","grades","football")
print(my_tup)
del(my_tup)
print("After deleting my_tup:")
print(my_tup)
</pre>
</div>
This produces the following result:
<div class="code">
<pre>
('school', 'reading', 'grades', 'football')
After deleting my_tup:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/Fawaz/AppData/Local/Programs
  /Python/Python37-32/aaa.py", line 5, in
  < module >
    print(my_tup)
NameError: name 'my_tup' is not defined
</pre>
</div>
Note − An exception is raised. This is because after del my_tup, the tuple does not exist any more.

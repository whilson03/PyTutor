<h1><b><u>Tuples</u></b></h1><br>
A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The main
difference between the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists.
Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally, you can put
these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example
<p class="one">tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000) <br>
    tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) <br>
    tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d" </p>
The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing.
<p class="one">tup1 = (); </p>
To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only
one value.
<p class="one">tup1 = (50,) </p>
Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.</p>
<u><b>Accessing Values in Tuples</b></u> <br>
To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to
obtain the value available at that index. For example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)<br>
    tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) <br>
    print ("tup1[0]: ", tup1[0]) <br>
    print ("tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5]) </p>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">tup1[0]: physics <br>
    tup2[1:5]: [2, 3, 4, 5] </p>
<u><b>Updating Tuples</b></u><br>
Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are
able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example
demonstrates.</p>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>

    tup1 = (12, 34.56) <br>
    tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz') <br>

    # Following action is not valid for tuples <br>
    # tup1[0] = 100; <br>

    # So let's create a new tuple as follows<br>
    tup3 = tup1 + tup2<br>
    print (tup3)<br>
    When the above code is executed, it produces the following result
<p class="one">(12, 34.56, 'abc', 'xyz') </p>
<b><u>Delete Tuple Elements</u></b><br>
Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting
together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.</p>
To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the del statement. For example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    tup = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000); <br>
    print (tup) <br>
    del tup; <br>
    print "After deleting tup : " <br>
    print tup </p>
This produces the following result.
Note: An exception is raised. This is because after del tup, tuple does not exist any more.
<p class="one">('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)<br>
    After deleting tup : <br>
    Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
    File "test.py", line 9, in
    <module><br>
        print tup;
</p>
<u><b>Basic Tuples Operations</b></u>
Tuples respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition
here too, except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.
In fact, tuples respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the previous
chapter.</p>

<u><b>Indexing, Slicing, and Matrixes</b></u><br>
Since tuples are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for tuples as they do for
strings, assuming the following input<br>
T=('C++', 'Java', 'Python')
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Python Expression</th>
        <th> Results</th>
        <th> Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>T[2]</td>
        <td>'Python'</td>
        <td> Offsets start at zero</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>T[-2]</td>
        <td> 'Java'</td>
        <td> Negative: count from the right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>T[1:]</td>
        <td> ('Java', 'Python')</td>
        <td> Slicing fetches sections</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<u><b>Built-in Tuple Functions </b></u><br>
Python includes the following tuple functions</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>SN</th>
        <th> Function with Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>cmp(tuple1, tuple2)<br>
            No longer available in Python 3.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td> len(tuple)<br>
            Gives the total length of the tuple.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td> max(tuple)<br>
            Returns item from the tuple with max value.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td> min(tuple) <br>
            Returns item from the tuple with min value.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td> tuple(seq)<br>
            Converts a list into tuple.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h1><b>Python Files I/O</b></h1>
<p>This chapter will cover all the basic I/O functions available in Python. For more
    functions,please refer to standard Python documentation. </p>
<u><b> Printing To The Screen</b></u><br>
The simplest way to produce output is using the print statement where you can pass zero or more
expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and
writes the result to standard output as follows:</p>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python<br>print "Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?";</p>
This would produce the following result on your standard screen:<br>
<p class="one">Python is really a great language, isn't it? </p>
<u><b>Reading Keyboard Input</b></u><br>
Python 2 has two built-in functions to read data from standard input, which by default comes from
the keyboard. These functions are <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b>
In Python 3, <b>raw_input()</b> function is deprecated. Moreover, input() functions read data from
keyboard as string, irrespective of whether it is enclosed with quotes ('' or "" ) or not.</p>
<b><u>The input Function</u></b>
The input([prompt]) function is equivalent to <b>raw_input</b>, except that it assumes that the
input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>

    >>> x=input("something:")<br>
    something:10 <br>
    >>> x <br>
    '10' <br>
    >>> x=input("something:") <br>
    something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without '' <br>
    >>> x <br>
    "'10'"<br>
    17</p>
<u><b>Opening and Closing Files:</b></u><br>
Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how
to play with actual data files.</p>
Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do
your most of the file manipulation using a file object.</p>
<u><b>The Open Function</b></u><br>
Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function.
This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods
associated with it.</p>
<b><u>Synthax</u></b>
<p class="one">file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering]) </p>
Here is paramters' detail:
<ul>
    <li>file_name: The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that
        you want to access.
    </li>

    <li>access_mode: The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e.,
        read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table.
        This is an optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).
    </li>

    <li>buffering: If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering
        value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering
        value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated
        buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default (default behavior).
    </li>
</ul>

<u><b>The file object attributes:</b></u><br>
Once a file is opened and you have one file object, you can get various information related to that
file.</p>
Here is a list of all attributes related to file object:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <b>Attribute</b>
            </th>

            </td>
            <td>
                Returns access mode with which file was opened.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                file.name
            </td>
            <td>
                Returns name of the file.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                file.softspace
            </td>
            <td>
                Returns false if space explicitly required with print, true otherwise.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<b>Note:</b> softspace attribute is not supported in Python 3.x </p>
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    # Open a file <br>
    fo = open("foo.txt", "wb") <br>
    print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name) <br>
    print ("Closed or not : ", fo.closed) <br>
    print ("Opening mode : ", fo.mode) <br>
    fo.close()</p>
This would produce the following result:<br>
<p class="one">Name of the file: foo.txt <br>
    Closed or not : False<br>
    Opening mode : wb </p>
<u><b>The close() Method</b></u><br>
The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object,
after which no more writing can be done.</p>
Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another
file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.</p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b><br>
<p class="one">fileObject.close(); </p>
EXAMPLE
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3<br>
    # Open a file <br>
    fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")<br>
    print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)<br>
    # Close opened file <br>
    fo.close() </p>
<u><b>Reading and Writing Files:</b></u><br>
The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would see how to use
read() and write() methods to read and write files.</p>
<b><u>The write() Method:</u></b><br>
he write() method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can
have binary data and not just text.</p>
The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string:</p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b><br>
<p class="one">fileObject.write(string); </p>
Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.
Example
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python3 <br>
    # Open a file <br>
    fo = open("foo.txt", "w")<br>
    fo.write( "Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n") <br>

    # Close opend file <br>


    fo.close(),</p>
The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and finally it
would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have following content.<br><br>
<p class="one">Python is a great language.<br>
    Yeah its great!!</p>
<b><u>The read() Method:</u></b><br>
The read() method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can
have binary data and not just text.</p>
Syntax<br>
<p class="one"> fileObject.read([count]);</p>
Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method starts
reading from the beginning of the file and if count is missing, then it tries to read as much as
possible, maybe until the end of file.</p>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Let's take a file foo.txt, which we have created above.<br>
<p class="one">#!/usr/bin/python<br>

                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")<br>
                str = fo.read(10);<br>
                print ("Read String is : ", str)<br>
                # Close opened file<br>
    fo.close()</p>
This would produce the following result:<br>
<p class="one"> Read String is : Python is</p>
<u><b>File Position</b></u><br>
        The tell() method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next
read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.</p>
        The seek(offset[, from]) method changes the current file position. The offset argument
        indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The from argument specifies the reference
position from where the bytes are to be moved.</p>
        If from is set to 0, it means use the beginning of the file as the reference position and 1
        means use the current position as the reference position and if it is set to 2 then the end
of the file would be taken as the reference position.</p>
        EXAMPLE:
        <br>Let's take a file foo.txt, which we have created above.
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
    s
                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")<br>
                str = fo.read(10);<br>
                print ("Read String is : ", str)<br>
                <br>
                # Check current position<br>
                position = fo.tell();<br>
                print ("Current file position : ", position)<br>
                <br>
                # Reposition pointer at the beginning once again<br>
                position = fo.seek(0, 0);<br>
                str = fo.read(10);<br>
                print "Again read String is : ", str<br>
                # Close opened file<br>
    fo.close()</p>
        This would produce the following result:<br>
<p class="one"> Read String is : Python is<br>
                Current file position : 10<br>
    Again read String is : Python is</p>
<u><b> Renaming and Deleting Files</b></u><br>
        Python os module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as
renaming and deleting files.</p>
To use this module you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.</p>
<u><b>The rename() Method:</b></u><br>
The rename() method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.</p>
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one">os.rename(current_file_name, new_file_name)</p>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Following is the example to rename an existing file test1.txt:
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # Rename a file from test1.txt to test2.txt<br>
    os.rename( "test1.txt", "test2.txt" )</p>
<u><b>The remove() Method:</u></b><br>
You can use the remove() method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be deleted as
the argument.</p>
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one">os.remove(file_name)</p>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to delete an existing file test2.txt:
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                # Delete file test2.txt<br>
    os.remove("text2.txt")</p>
<u><b>Directories in Python:</u></b><br>
All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these too.
The os module has several methods that help you create, remove and change directories.</p>
<b><u> The mkdir() Method </u></b><br>
        You can use the mkdir() method of the os module to create directories in the current
directory. You need to supply an argument to this method which contains the name of the directory to
be created.</p>
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one"> os.mkdir("newdir")</p>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to create a directory test in the current directory:
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # Create a directory "test"<br>
    os.mkdir("test")</p>
<b><u>The chdir() Method</u></b><br>
You can use the chdir() method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an
argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current directory.</p>
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one"> os.chdir("newdir")</p>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Following is the example to go into "/home/newdir" directory:</p>
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                # Changing a directory to "/home/newdir"<br>
    os.chdir("/home/newdir")</p>
<b><u> The getcwd() Method</u></b><br>
        The getcwd() method displays the current working directory.
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one>"> os.getcwd()</p>
EXAMPLE:</p>
Following is the example to give current directory</p>
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
    # This would give location of the current directory<br>
    os.getcwd()</p>
<b><u>The rmdir()Method</u></b><br>
The rmdir() method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method Before
removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.</p>
Syntax:<br>
<p class="one"> os.rmdir('dirname')</p>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to remove "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully
        qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current
directory.</p>
<p class="one"> #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
    # This would remove "/tmp/test" directory.<br>
    os.rmdir( "/tmp/test" )</p>
<b><u> File & Directory Related Methods:</u></b><br>
        There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility methods to handle
        and manipulate files & directories on Windows and Unix operating systems. They are as
        follows:

<ul>
    <li>File Object Methods: The file object provides functions
            to manipulate files.
        </li>
    <li>OS Object Methods: This provides methods to process files as
            well as directories.
        </li>
    </ul>

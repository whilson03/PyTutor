<section>
    <p>
        This chapter will cover all the basic I/O functions available in Python. For more functions,
        please refer to standard Python documentation.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Printing To The Screen
    </h4>
    <p>
        The simplest way to produce output is using the print statement where you can pass zero or
        more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a
        string and writes the result to standard output as follows:
        <br>
        <mark><code>
            #!/usr/bin/python<br>print "Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?";
        </code></mark>
        <br>
        This would produce the following result on your standard screen:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>Python is really a great language, isn't it?</code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>Reading Keyboard Input:</h4>
    <p>
        Python provides two built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which by
        default comes from the keyboard. These functions are:
        <br>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item active">raw_input</li>
        <li class="list-group-item disabled">input</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>The <i>Raw_input</i> function</h4>
    <p>
        The <i>raw_input([prompt])</i> function reads one line from standard input and returns it as
        a string (removing the trailing newline).
        <br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                str = raw_input("Enter your input: ");<br>
                print "Received input is : ", str
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        This would prompt you to enter any string and it would display same string on the screen.
        When I typed "Hello Python!", its output is like this:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                Enter your input: Hello Python<br>
                Received input is : Hello Python
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h4>The <i>input</i> Function</h4>
    <p>
        The <i>input([prompt])</i> function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the
        input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.
        <br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                str = input("Enter your input: ");<br>
                print "Received input is : ", str<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
        This would produce the following result against the entered input:
        <mark>
            <code>
                Enter your input: [x*5 for x in range(2,10,2)]<br>
                Recieved input is : [10, 20, 30, 40]<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Opening and Closing Files:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will
        see how to play with actual data files.
        <br>
        Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You
        can do your most of the file manipulation using a file object.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>open</i> Function
    </h4>
    <p>
        Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open()
        function. This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to call other support
        methods associated with it.
        <br>SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        Here is paramters' detail:
        <
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item active"><b>file_name:</b> The file_name argument is a string
            value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item active"><b>access_mode:</b> The access_mode determines the mode
            in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of
            possible values is given below in the table. This is optional parameter and the default
            file access mode is read (r)..
        </li>
        li class="list-group-item active"><b>buffering:</b> If the buffering value is set to 0, no
        buffering will take place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering will be performed
        while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1,
        then buffering action will be performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the
        buffer size is the system default(default behavior).</li>
    </ul>

    EXAMPLE:<br>
    <mark>
        <code>
            #!/usr/bin/python<br><br>

            # Open a file<br>
            fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")<br>
            print "Name of the file: ", fo.name<br>
            print "Closed or not : ", fo.closed<br>
            print "Opening mode : ", fo.mode<br>
            print "Softspace flag : ", fo.softspace<br>
        </code>
    </mark>
    <br>
    This would produce the following result:<br>
    <mark>
        <code>
            Name of the file: foo.txt<br>
            Closed or not : False<br>
            Opening mode : wb<br>
            Softspace flag : 0<br>
        </code>
    </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>clode()</i> Method
    </h4>
    <p>
        The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file
        object, after which no more writing can be done.

        <br>Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to
        another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.
        <br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                fileObject.close();
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")<br>
                print "Name of the file: ", fo.name<br>

                # Close opend file<br>
                fo.close()<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
        This would produce the following result:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                Name of the file: foo.txt
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Reading and Writing Files:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The <i>file</i> object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would
        see how to use read() and write() methods to read and write files.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>write()</i> Method:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The <i>write()</i> method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that
        Python strings can have binary data and not just text.
        <br>The <i>write()</i> method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the
        string:<br>
        <br>SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                fileObject.write(string);
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")<br>
                fo.write( "Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n");<br>

                # Close opend file<br>
                fo.close()<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and
        finally it would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have following
        content.<br><br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                Python is a great language.<br>
                Yeah its great!!<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>read()</i> Method:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The read() method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python
        strings can have binary data and not just text.
        <br>SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                fileObject.read([count]);
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method
        starts reading from the beginning of the file and if count is missing, then it tries to read
        as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.
        <br><br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Let's take a file foo.txt, which we have created above.<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")<br>
                str = fo.read(10);<br>
                print "Read String is : ", str<br>
                # Close opend file<br>
                fo.close()
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        This would produce the following result:<br><br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                Read String is : Python is
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        File Positions:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The tell() method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next
        read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.
        <br>
        The seek(offset[, from]) method changes the current file position. The offset argument
        indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The from argument specifies the reference
        position from where the bytes are to be moved.
        <br>
        If from is set to 0, it means use the beginning of the file as the reference position and 1
        means use the current position as the reference position and if it is set to 2 then the end
        of the file would be taken as the reference position.
        <br><br>
        EXAMPLE:
        <br>Let's take a file foo.txt, which we have created above.
        <br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>

                # Open a file<br>
                fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")<br>
                str = fo.read(10);<br>
                print "Read String is : ", str<br>
                <br>

    <h4>
        Renaming and Deleting Files
    </h4>
    <p>
        Python os module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as
        renaming and deleting files.
        <br>
        To use this module you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The rename() Method:
    </h4>
    <p>
        The rename() method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.
        <br><br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.rename(current_file_name, new_file_name)
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to rename an existing file test1.txt:
        <br><br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # Rename a file from test1.txt to test2.txt<br>
                os.rename( "test1.txt", "test2.txt" )<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>remove() </i> Method:
    </h4>
    <p>
        You can use the remove() method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be
        deleted as the argument.
        <br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.remove(file_name)
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to delete an existing file test2.txt:
        <br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # Delete file test2.txt<br>
                os.remove("text2.txt")<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Directories in Python:
    </h4>
    <p>
        All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these
        too. The os module has several methods that help you create, remove and change directories.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>mkdir()</i> Method
    </h4>
    <p>
        You can use the mkdir() method of the os module to create directories in the current
        directory. You need to supply an argument to this method which contains the name of the
        directory to be created.<br><br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.mkdir("newdir")
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to create a directory test in the current directory:
        <br>

            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # Create a directory "test"<br>
                os.mkdir("test")<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>The <i>chdir()</i> Method</h4>
    <p>
        You can use the chdir() method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an
        argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current
        directory.<br><br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.chdir("newdir")
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>Following is the example to go into "/home/newdir" directory:<br><br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>

                # Changing a directory to "/home/newdir"<br>
                os.chdir("/home/newdir")<br>
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>getcwd()</i> Method
    </h4>
    <p>
        The getcwd() method displays the current working directory.
        <br><br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.getcwd()
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>

                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # This would give location of the current directory
                <br>os.getcwd()
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The <i>rmdir()</i> Method
    </h4>
    <p>
        The rmdir() method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method.
        <br>
        Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.
        <br><br>
        SYNTAX:<br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                os.rmdir('dirname')
            </code>
        </mark>
        <br><br>
        EXAMPLE:<br>
        Following is the example to remove "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully
        qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current
        directory.<br><br>
        <mark>
            <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python<br>
                import os<br>
                <br>
                # This would remove "/tmp/test" directory.
                <br>os.rmdir( "/tmp/test" )
            </code>
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h4>
        File & Directory Related Methods:
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility methods to handle
        and manipulate files & directories on Windows and Unix operating systems. They are as
        follows:
        <
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item active">File Object Methods: The file object provides functions
            to manipulate files.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item ">OS Object Methods: This provides methods to process files as
            well as directories.
        </li>
    </ul>

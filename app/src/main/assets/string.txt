String is a Data type in python. The data stored in memory can be of many types.

Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them
and the storage method for each of them.



String is a Data type in python.

Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.

Python allows either pair of single or double quotes.Multi-line strings can be denoted using triple quotes, ''' or """

Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the
beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.

Example

school = "my cool school" # double quotes is used

name = 'jack jack' # single quotes is used

long_name = """     # multi line string
    my
    multiline
    name
    """

print(school)
print(name)
print(long_name)

my cool school
jack jack
    my
    multiline
    name


Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.


hero = "Batman"

print(hero) # Prints complete string
print(hero[0]) # Prints first character of the string

print(hero[0:4]) # Prints characters starting from 1st to the 3rd
print (str[2:]) # Prints the whole string starting from 3rd character

Batman
B
Batm
tman




Strings can also be index backwards. The last character is -1

print(hero[-1]) # Prints the last character in the string
print(hero[-3: -1]) # Prints the 3rd and 2nd character from behind in the string


String Concatenation.

The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition
operator

greeting = "Hello"
print(greeting * 2)
print(greeting + "World")
print("Welcome  " + "back")

N.B: The Spaces at the end of `Welcome` are also characters in the String.

HelloWorld
Welcome  back

language = "Python"
print(language[0:6:2])

A very common case when working with Strings is to know how many characters it contain. Python has and handy function for that.

len() is used to get the number of characters in a String.
language = "Python"

print(len(language))

6


Apart from len() there several other Built-In Functions for working and manipulating Strings in Python.

whats the output?
print(len("hello"))

5
6
Error

Whats the output?
name = 'Wilson"
print(name[0])

Error
Wilson
W

Whats the output?
name = "Pytutor"
print(name[0: len(name) - 1 ])

Pytuto
Pytutor
Error


Which is used for multi-line Strings.

''
""
""" """ , ''' '''
